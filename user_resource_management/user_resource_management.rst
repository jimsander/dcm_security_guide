Resource Security by User
-------------------------

One way to control access to Cloud Resources is by user. When resources are created from the Dell Cloud Manager console or from the Dell Cloud Manager API (using a user level API key), they are owned by the user that created them (owning user). 
Access rights can then be configured for those resources and controlled by the **MINE** qualifier.
Users that do not own the resources will not be able to access and perform actions against those resources controlled by access rights with the **MINE** qualifier.
