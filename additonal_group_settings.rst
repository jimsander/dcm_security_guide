Additional Group Settings
-------------------------

There are additional settings that can be configured on a group which control whether or not members of the group can:

* Manage company settings, cloud accounts, alerts, reports and budgeting.
* Manage user access settings (creating, modifying and deleting users, groups, roles and access rights).
* Alter configuration management (creating, modifying and deleting Chef or Puppet accounts).
