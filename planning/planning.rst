Planning
--------

Before you start creating Groups, Roles and Access Rights you need to:

1. Define the different types of users that you need consider in your security implementation (**Role**\ s)
2. Define what resources need to be controlled for each Role (**Resource** Types)
3. Define what action(s) need to be controlled for each resource in each Role (**Action**\ s)
4. Define how you want to scope each resource for each action, in each Access Right, in each Role (**Qualifier**\ s)
