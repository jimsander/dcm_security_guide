Resource Security by Group
--------------------------

One way to control access to Cloud Resources is by group. When resources are created from the Dell Cloud Manager console or from the Dell Cloud Manager API (using a user level API key), they can be assigned to a Dell Cloud Manager group (owning group). 
Access rights can then be configured for those resources and controlled by the **GROUP** qualifier. Users that do not belong to the Group that owns the resources will not be able to access and perform actions against those resources controlled by access rights with the **GROUP** qualifier.
