Implementation
--------------

Now you need to decide how you are going to implement your Dell Cloud Manager Cloud security objectives.

What roles do you need to create?  For each role:

* What access rights do you need to create in the role?
 
 * What Resources need to be defined in the role?
 * What Actions for each resource need to be defined?
 * What Qualifier needs to be defined for each action?
    
  * Allow "any" access for the action?
  * Restrict to "Group" ownership for the action?
  * Restrict to "user" ownership for the action?
