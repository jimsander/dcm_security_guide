Resource Types
--------------


The **Actions** determine what “actions” the Access Right will allow for the Resource type. All actions can be allowed or specific actions can be allowed. The allowable actions differ depending upon the Resource type.

.. note:: In the following definitions, where a description contains **Qualifer Indistinct**, it means the *Action* does not distinguish a difference between the *Qualifers* ( Mine, Group or Any ).  Any *Qualifier* specified will result in the same behavior.

.. note:: Common for each Resource Type is the action *Access* which provides the ability to both view the DCM resource type and also use the additional actions of that resource type
