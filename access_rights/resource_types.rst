Resource Types
--------------

The **Actions** determine what “actions” the Access Right will allow for the Resource type. All actions can be allowed or specific actions can be allowed. The allowable actions differ depending upon the Resource type.

.. note:: Where a description contains **Qualifer Ignored**, the qualifer value for an **Action** is either all or none; in other words, whether value is MINE or GROUP, is same affect as ANY, but no value will be no access as expected.
